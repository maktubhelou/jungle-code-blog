# The great Gatsby!

### What I love about Gatsby? Let me count the ways:

1. It's intuitive.
2. It does the heavy lifting.
3. It's fast. Like... the websites are fast.
4. It's got a great support community.
5. Cool devs like Wes Bos seem to dig it.
6. The whole Headless CMS bandwagon.
7. Plugins galore. Plug in all the things!
8. Great documentation.
9. I made this blog in like... 1/2 a day with it.
10. It's Great. You might even call it: The Great Gatsby.
