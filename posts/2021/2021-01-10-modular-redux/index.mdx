# Redux... but Modular!

A look at Modular Redux (conceptual)

### Why use Modular Redux

Let's face it. There's a whole lot of boilerplate in Redux. We love Redux for scalable applications, but we hate redux for scalabel applications. Modular redux to the rescue.

### Advantages
- Less boilerplate
- Build faster, like a LOT faster
- Less bugs
- Did I mention less boilerplate?

I haven't really had a chance to dive into this yet but, I'm going to be taking a look at this healthy list of promising resources:
- [Modular Redux â€” a Design Pattern for Mastering Scalable, Shared State in React](https://shanebdavis.medium.com/modular-redux-a-design-pattern-for-mastering-scalable-shared-state-82d4abc0d7b3)
- [Modular Redux](https://www.genui.com/resources/modular-redux)
- [Modular redux architecture](https://dev.to/jovidecroock/modular-redux-57nl)

These definitely look promising to help me with a current project that has enough Redux boilerplate to block out the Sun.
