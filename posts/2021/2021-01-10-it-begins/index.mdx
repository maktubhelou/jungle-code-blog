## er... Began!

This is the story all about how my life... I flipped it, turned it upside down.

Really, it's about time I started writing about the coding journey I embarked on about 3 years ago. It's been a wild and crazy ride. No regrets. Except, that this is the first time I start blogging about it. Now, let's see if I can `commit` to it. I'll be looking into the past and present, and maybe even the future to chronicle where I came from, where I am, who I am, and where I'm going.

Why Jungle Code? Well... it was inspired by something about a Banana Monkey Jungle Problem.

*** Disclaimer: most of the code here is a shameless following of the step-by-step tutorial here [How to Build Your Coding Blog From Scratch Using Gatsby and MDX](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-developer-blog-from-scratch-with-gatsby-and-mdx/) by [Scott Spence](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/scott/) who has also written a tonne of other useful stuff that no one should ever shamelessly copy. But hey, I got roses to stop and smell and I'm on a mission.
